# MCP Implementation Patterns and Best Practices

## Implementing an MCP Server
- Use a well-defined API (REST/gRPC) to expose MCP endpoints.
- Validate all incoming context data for schema compliance.
- Support versioning for backward compatibility.
- Log all context exchanges for traceability.

## Implementing an MCP Client
- Use client libraries or SDKs when available.
- Handle server errors gracefully and implement retries.
- Cache context data when appropriate to reduce server load.

## Best Practices
- Secure context data in transit (TLS/SSL).
- Use authentication and authorization for sensitive operations.
- Document your MCP endpoints and expected context schemas.
